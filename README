Compilation
-----------

xstart uses cmake as its build system for most platforms. It is highly recommended to 
make a out-of-source build. To make a out-of-source build, do something like:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

There is no default generator target, common generators like Makefiles, Codeblocks or MSVC
should compile without trouble. Refer to the cmake manual or run cmake without options for
help on cmake.

After build xstart, the binaries are stored in the "bin" folder.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is generated by and within xstart itself. 


Editor
------

A scite based editor can be found in the editor subdirectory.
